# spring-game-tracker

A simple Spring Boot API that manages video games and their metadata. My goal is to eventually connect this backend to frontend (such as React), but it can be used as a standalone JSON API.

**Note:** This is a project-based learning experience for me. I am using this project to learn more about Spring Boot and RESTful backend development.

### What this project is helping me learn:

- Spring Framework
- Spring Boot
- Backend Development
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
- Constructor Injection & Layered Architecture
- Returning JSON Responses

### What I'm working on:

- JUnit Testing & Test-Driven Development
- POST/PUT Endpoints
- Database Support with MongoDB
- A connected frontend

Feel free to follow along or provide any feedback! I'm open to any questions, comments, or concerns. At the end of the day, I just want to learn as much as I can!

## Features

- Get a list of games (`GET /games`)
- Modular Structure with MVC Architecture
  - Controller and Service Layers (for now)
- JSON Output
- Designed to evolve and grow as I learn more about backend development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine before running locally:

- Java 17+ (`java -version`)
- Maven
  - This project uses **Maven** - if you'd like to use **Gradle** instead, you'd need to manually convert the build configuration
- An IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS-Code)
